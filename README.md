Long-running cluster
By default, clusters that you create with the console or the AWS CLI are long-running. Long-running clusters continue to run, accept work, and accrue charges until you take action to shut them down.

A long-running cluster is effective in the following situations:

When you need to interactively or automatically query data.

When you need to interact with big data applications hosted on the cluster on an ongoing basis.

When you periodically process a data set so large or so frequently that it is inefficient to launch new clusters and load data each time.
